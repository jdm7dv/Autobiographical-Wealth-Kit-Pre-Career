Looper (version 1.5)______________________________________________________________________Looper is free.You can give it away. Please keep this documentation intact.Looper lives at http://www.sirius.com/~ear/software.htmlOther software I have written can be found there as well.You can contact me (ear@sirius.com) if you have questions, suggestions,or insights regarding Looper. All sorts of things about my music anddelicate ear can be discovered at http://www.sirius.com/~ear.loops <-> spool jhno______________________________________________________________________Introduction______________________________________________________________________Looper is a real-time loop sampler that runs on Power Macintoshcomputers. It is also an algorithmic sound collage machine that canautomatically create new musical textures out of existing CD's, or other audio input.Looper is programmed in MAX and MSP. MAX is an object-orientedprogramming environment available from Opcode Systems (www.opcode.com).MSP is a set of objects that plug into MAX, enabling it to work withdigital audio and signal processing. It is available from Cycling74(www.cycling74.com).If you are not familiar with this environment, I can wholeheartedlyrecommend it as an excellent platform for experimenting with sound oncomputers. Keep your eye on both Cycling74 and delicate ear forinteresting new software tools.______________________________________________________________________Which Version?______________________________________________________________________Looper is available as a MAX patcher, or a standalone application. Usethe standalone application if you do not have MAX or MAXPlay, version3.5.9. The "loopersets" folder must be in the same folder as theLooper application in order to save and load settings. If you own MAX, the "patcher" version lets you open up the Looper, seehow it works, and make changes. If you make some interesting changes,why not drop me a line and let me know what you did? I am alwayscurious.If you are using the patcher, the "loopersets" folder must be in thesame folder as your MAX application in order to save and load settings.Also, the subptacher "lc" must be in MAX's search path. Finally, Looper uses updated MSP objects, and a few third-party MAX objects. If the patcher isn't working, or you are getting "no such object" messages, there is a "looper objects" archive on my web site. It contains the precise version of several objects I used. Try installing those objects. If you still have trouble, let me know.______________________________________________________________________Getting Started______________________________________________________________________Open Looper. You should see the main Looper screen. There are three "loop channels", each with its own controls.In order for it to function, you must turn on Looper via the masteron/off switch - the big checkbox on the left, labeled "on/off". Thisenables audio and starts the metronome.Looper can accept sound input from any Sound Manager source. To changethe audio input source, click on the button labeled "audio config".There is a pop-up menu to select an input source. You can select "CD"if you have a CD-ROM drive with an audio CD. You need to use theAppleCD player, the Control Strip, or something else to start the CDplaying.You can see the level of the audio input by Looper's "input level"meter. You can monitor the audio input by clicking on the "audio thru"switch.Once you have verified that input is present, try hitting the recordswitch on one of the loop channels (the switch is labeled "rec"). Turnit on just for a second, then off again. This will record a fragment ofaudio into that loop. It will immediately start to repeat, according tothe master tempo and the channel's loop length.Experiment with the loop's parameters, especially length, speed, rev,and the sliders (V stands for volume, F for cutoff frequency, and Q forresonance). You have to turn on the filter to hear it. The Reference section below tells you what each control does.Meanwhile if you want to hear a few example settings, click on the"read" button that is in the bottom, left corner of the window. Thiswill present a dialog box to read in a Looper setting. Type in the word"demo" and hit ok. In a few seconds, Looper will update itself to acomplex setting that creates interesting sound collages out of theinput source (try some tasteful CD's).Looper includes five demos. They are very simple, I just threw themtogether to demonstrate a couple of possibilities. There are many more. To hear a demo, click on the "read" button as above and type the name,e.g. "demo2". Here is a brief description of each one:demo - the classic looper demo: confusing and pleasurabledemo2 - a much simpler setting for random samplingdemo3 - an example of fast changes demo4 - two low goopy loops with another floating around demo5 - makes any source mellowNote that the sound you get from Looper completely depends on what youput into it. Have fun experimenting...!______________________________________________________________________Reference______________________________________________________________________The rest of the documentation describes how each control in the Looperwindow works. There are three sections, the Master Controls, the LoopChannels, and the Automation. Each parameter description is preceded by"()()()" so you can scan through them.______________________________________________________________________Master Controls______________________________________________________________________()()() metronome tempo (BPM)This sets the master tempo for the Looper. It determines the length ofthe loops (see "length" in the Loop Channels section). ()()() on/offThis switch enables audio, and turns on the metronome.()()() loop sizeClick here to change the size of the loop buffers. It presents a dialogbox in which to enter the new maximum loop length in milliseconds. Notethat this is limited by the amount of memory that has been assigned toLooper. To increase Looper's memory, select the Looper application (orMAX, if you are using the patcher version) in the Finder and choose"Get Info" from the File menu. Here you can set the "Minimum Size" and"Preferred Size" of Looper's memory.As a rule of thumb,  Looper needs about a megabyte of memory for everytwo seconds of loop time. Also, it needs about 3.3 MB just to run, plusabout a megabyte of Mystery Memory. So, if you want 10 seconds of looptime, you will need to assign Looper at least (3.3 MB + 1 MB (1 MB x5)) = 9.3 MB.If you want to see how much memory Looper has free, type command-M, orselect "Max" from the Windows menu. This gives you a status windowwhich shows free memory in the upper right-hand corner. If you try tomake the loop size larger than memory will allow, you will get errormessages in this window. Just ignore those "divide by zero errors", though. Dividing by zero is good. Hint: Try not to resize the loops too often, if you are tight onmemory. Each time you enter a new loop size, it seems to slightlydecrease the memory available, even though this is not indicated in thestatus window. So, the best thing to do is resize the loops only once,right after starting the program. If you have plenty of memory, don'tworry about this.()()() audio configThis button opens the "DSP Status" window, which lets you assign theaudio input source. You can also see the "CPU Utilization" - whichtells you how hard your computer is working. If this number gets closeto 100%, you might start to experience clicks and dropouts. If thishappens, you can try changing the "Sampling Rate" parameter. Lowersampling rates take proportionally less CPU time to compute. As well,you could experiment with the "I/O Vector Size" and "Signal VectorSize" parameters, which affect performance to a lesser degree.Checking "Scheduler in Audio Interrupt" can improve the timing of theloops. The difference is not usually noticeable, but it can definitelyhelp with very small, fast loops.()()() record to diskClicking here presents a standard dialog box to create a new digitalaudio file on your hard disk. Just enter a name and save it somewhereyou have enough disk space. Looper will immediately start to record itsdigital audio output into this file. Click on this box again to stoprecording and close the file. You will then have a stereo AIFF digital recording of Looper on your hard disk.()()() input levelThis is a stereo meter that shows the level of the audio input.()()() output levelThis is a stereo meter that shows the level of the audio output. Thereis a fader attached to it that lets you adjust the overall outputvolume.()()() read/write presetHere you can save and load settings for the entire Looper. The "write"button will store all parameters of each loop channel, plus the mastertempo, on/off switch, audio thru, and output volume. It will ask you for a name to store the preset. *** Do not enter any spaces or colonsin this name. *** For example, "spool_2" is fine, but "spool 2" is not.When you hit the "read" button, you will get a similar dialog box. Justtype in the name of a preset you have saved (or a pre-existing demo)and wait a few seconds for the Looper to update.Note that Looper stores all its preset files in the "loopersets"folder. This folder must be located in the same place as the Looperapplication, or the MAX application if you are using the patcherversion. Inside you can see all the files it creates. Someday thismight be more elegant.______________________________________________________________________Loop Channels______________________________________________________________________()()() recThis button starts and stops recording into the loop channel. If youleave it on, it will continue recording as it loops. Usually you willhear the sound as you are recording it. It seems to be a bitinconsistent, though, and will sometimes record sound into a differentpart of the loop. This is part of the "randomness" of the Looper, itscharacter and charm. To complain about such behavior is to rail againstthe very seed of creativity that created the entire universe. In serendipity lies music...()()() lengthThis specifies the length of the loop, in 16th notes according to themaster tempo. So, if the length is set to 16 the loop will be one barlong. At 120 BPM this is two seconds.Hint: set each loop channel to different loop lengths to get alayered, non-repeating texture.()()() offsetThis changes the position of the loop with regards to the master tempo.It is an offset from "the beginning of the bar" - specified, again, in16th notes. You can use this parameter to offset loops from each other,and get them into (or out of) sync.()()() delay (ms)This is a delay, in milliseconds, that again offsets the loop. You canuse this to fine-tune the synchronization between loop channels.()()() revChecking this box will make the loop play backward.()()() speedThis specifies the speed of the loop playback, as a percentage oforiginal speed. So, a value of 100 plays the sound back at the pitch itwas recorded, while 50 gives you half speed and 200 gives youdouble speed.()()() start pointThis is an offset, in milliseconds, into the loops memory buffer. Itchanges the start position of the tape, as it were. It is most usefulif you have recorded a long loop, say at a loop length of 16, and thenyou scale the loop length back or slow down the tempo. You can then usethis parameter to slide through the loop and access different sectionsof it.()()() V (volume)This sets the volume of the loop channel.()()() F (filter)This sets the cutoff frequency of the channel's low-pass filter. Notethat it will have no effect unless the filter is turned on.()()() Q (resonance)This sets the resonance of the channel's low-pass filter. Note that itwill have no effect unless the filter is turned on.()()() panThis is the horizontal slider directly under the V, F, and Q sliders.It pans the loop channel to the left or right.()()() level meterThis is the horizontal meter underneath the pan slider. It indicatesthe audio output level of the loop channel.()()() filter on/offThis turns on and off the channel's filter. Note that with the filteron, the audio will be somewhat affected even if the filter's cutoff frequency is all the way up. So, if you want to preserve the original fidelity of the audio and you don't need filtering, leave the filter off.()()() save audioClick this button to save the contents of the loop channel onto yourhard disk as an AIFF file.()()() read audioClick this button to read in a mono AIFF file. You can use a file thatyou previously saved with the "save audio" function, or any otherone-channel AIFF file. *** If you try to read in a stereo ormulti-channel AIFF file Looper will probably crash. ***()()() clear audioThis erases the loop.()()() read/write presetThis lets you save and load settings for a single loop channel. This isuseful if you want to copy the settings from one channel to the others,or just to save a setting you like. Clicking the "write" button givesyou a standard dialog box, to write your preset as a file. Clicking the"read" button lets you load in any file that you have previously saved.After you read in a file, you have to click the little button under theword "preset" in order for the channel to update all its settings. Itis through work that an idle character is bettered, and sloth overcome.______________________________________________________________________Looper Automation______________________________________________________________________The grid of boxes at the bottom of each loop channel can be used torandomly automate the settings of the Looper. Each row in this grid canautomate a single parameter of the loop channel. Thus, up to 10parameters can be affected simultaneously. There are six settings ineach row, labeled at the bottom of the grid. Here is how they work:()()() onThis checkbox enables the automation specified in its row. You can usethis to turn the automation of a particular parameter on and off.()()() paramThis is a popup menu where you can select a loop channel parameter toautomate.()()() probThis probability determines how often the parameter will be randomlymodified. It is expressed in 16th notes. In other words, if the valueis 8, the parameter will be updated randomly on an average of onceevery eight 16th notes according to the master tempo. If the value is 1, it will update every single 16th note. If the value is 187, it will update very infrequently.()()() min, maxWhen a parameter is updated by the automation, it will be set to arandom value between the min and max settings. Note that the "record"and "reverse" parameters only have two values, on or off. A value of 0will turn these parameters off, and any other value will turn it on.()()() smoothHere you can specify the amount of time, in milliseconds, that it takesfor the parameter to reach its new value. If this is set to 1000, thenwhenever the automation updates this parameter it will smoothly fade toits new value over the course of a second. With a value of 0, theparameter will immediately jump to its new value.()()()()()()()()()()()()()()()()()()()()()()()()()()()()()()()()()()()here there be dragons
