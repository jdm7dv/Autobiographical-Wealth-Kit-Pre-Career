spattyis a reverb effect box using the "Spatialisateur" (Spat 1.2.2 IRCAM, Paris).You can store spatial movements, "orbits", which are then applied to soundfiles and spatialized. The orbit is adjusted to fit any asked-for sound duration.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------This folder contains*spatty											- main patchersoundfiles									- with subfolders 		drySounds 							- put YOUR sounds (AIFF or SD2 format) here		wetSounds 						-  the spattified files end up heredrySoundswetSounds									spattyFolderPathspattyMacShortcuts		- coll files; you do not need to worry about themhrtf_load.patorbiterWindoworbitRecord								- subpatchersspattyHelp								- picture of help window, you can open it inside spatty (press "h").ReadMeWhen you run spatty for the first time on a new location, you may receive an error message when starting up. You will then have to set the search path (click 'new folder') telling MAX where your spatty folder is located. See help for how to write names which MAX understands.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------spatty was made in March 2000 for a work by composer Joyce Bee Tuan Koh. The patcher is dedicated to K.N.Please send feedback to me on permagnuslindborg@email.com.
