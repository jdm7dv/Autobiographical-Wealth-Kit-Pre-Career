***lOOpA strange soundfile looper with a bunch of dots moving around the screen.***fLOW is a DSP computer program running on Apple Macintosh G3 (or fast PPC) machines. Written in MSP, it generates an ever-changing and never repeating soundscape in real time that fills the space with flooding sounds that resemble - metaphorically - the timbres of water, fire, earth, and air.***bOOm05082001A neat sequencer with an innacurate clock***bad 1.1 - maxlet***bas - maxlet***ford 1.1 - maxlet***lump 1.0 - maxlet***stupid 1.1 - maxletplease enjoymaxlet © 2000 Jeremy Bernsteinmusic © 2000 Thin Film Groupvideo © the original holdersupport copyright reformboot squad researchhttp://www.bootsquad.comjeremy@bootsquad.com*** AmazingMaze_PDThis realtime composition is a work-in-progress that have been started in spring 1996. It is represented by a computer program which generates music by manipulating sampled instrumental sounds according to certain compositional strategies which are carried out in different structure generators. Each of them synthesizes its own musical language of a characteristical kind.*** Mody* 1024/768 screen res.Mody is a "real-time audio/graphical excitator/model of resonance's interactions editor" using Max/MSP.*** convolver7.app(MAX).sitA non-realtime convolution process.*** decaydance/hudak.sitdecaydance is a 2 channel delay system with 2 built in soundprocessing modules, and with the option of loading in vst plugins.(note that Pluggo plugins cannot be used). the maximum delay time is10 seconds per delay line, as the programme is intended for shortinitial delays of between 100 and 1000ms (.01 to 1 second). for longerdelays use my program "hudak", which has delay times of up to 2minutes (depending on available ram).any comments/queries to david@resonant.demon.co.uk*** CamelToe_v1.0-Twerk.sitCamelToe_v1.0 is a randomized algorithmic sequencer/looper application made by Twerk.*** lifefilter.1.0.app(MAX).sitUses Cellular Automata to vary a filter over a sound.*** real-time granular synth 2.0A realtime granular synthesizer.*** vstPlayer14(MAX).appA non-realtime VST plugin rendering engine.*** xvst.sitAbout xVst:                                                   ***xVst00.07 is a small app that will loop an Audio File troughtwo VST plug-ins in series, and save the result as an AIFF file. freeware. made with MAX/MSP.
