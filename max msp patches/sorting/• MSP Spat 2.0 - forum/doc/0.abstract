Spat-1.1 - Abstract===================Spat is a 3-D audio rendering and artificial reverberation software allowing reconstruction of three-dimensional virtual sound scenes by processing and mixing mono or stereo source signals. The modularity and configurability make the software adaptable to a variety of application contexts, including musical composition in the studio, concert performance, sound reinforcement, post-production of recordings and soundtracks, multimedia or virtual reality systems.Spat runs in FTS, IRCAM's real-time audio and control signal processing server.  FTS is provided with an object-oriented graphical programming interface called Max. Max allows building signal processing and mixing architectures by connecting boxes representing FTS objects. Spat also runs in MSP, the signal processing extension of Opcode Max for Macintosh computers (thanks to a FTS-compatibility library for MSP).Features--------Spat extends the library of existing FTS objects to provide aneasy-to-use 3-D audio rendering object called Spat~.  A Spat~ objectreceives a mono or stereo source signal and applies directional panningand reverberation processing to produce a multi-channel output tofeed headphones or various loudspeaker setups in a wide variety offormats.A typical application of Spat consists of associating several Spat~objects in parallel, each receiving a different mono or stereo sourcesignal, and mixing their outputs to render a complex 3-D sound scene.Some key features of the Spat~ object are:- integrating directional panning and artificial reverberation in a  single processing module providing a high-level control interface- configurability according to the output format and the rendering  technique (can drive headphones or 2 to 8 louspeakers, using binaural  techniques, conventional stereo techniques, intensity panning,  B-format and Ambisonic decoding, Dolby-compatible encoding)- efficient and natural-sounding artificial reverberation algorithms,  and scalability of the reverberation model allowing to adapt the  fidelity / comptational cost trade-off according to the audio context  and the available resources- efficient implementation of binaural synthesis (HRTF filters) for  3-D spatialization over headphones and 2 or 4 loudspeakers- high-level control interface providing a set of control parameters  which is independent of the configuration of the output format and   of the reverberation model (see below).Spat object library-------------------The configurability of the Spat~ processor is made possible by anextensive library of elementary FTS objects for artificialreverberation, directional panning and decoding, and spectralequalization.The Spat library of Max objects includes, in particular :- A family of DSP modules for multichannel artificial reverberation (with various degrees of complexity as to the room response model and the feedback delay network), along with a higher-level user interface offering a perceptual control paradygm for specifying the reverberation effect;- A family of panning modules for the synthesis of localization cues over headphones or various arrangements of loudspeakers, using several formats or encoding approaches: intensity panning, B format and Ambisonic decoding, binaural techniques...;- An integrated module (Spat~) combining the above reverberation and directional panning functionnalities, which can be configured according to the reproduction format or setup (over headphones or loudspeakers).Installing Spat---------------The recommended path for installing Spat-1.1.2 is /LocalApps/Spat/Spat-1.1 on NeXT computers /usr/local/Spat/Spat-1.1 on SGI computers.	:Max 3.5.9 on Mac computer.For new users, we suggest reading the introduction manual (written for Spat-0.1) and the release notes in the Spat-1.1/doc folder. Both of these documentations are available on line on the 'Forumnet' server.The 'doc' folder in the installation also contains:Spat-1.0.README   : copyrights, etc...0.abstract        : this abstract1.introduction    : general presentation2.release_notes   : complements to the manuals3.getting started : copy of the release notesWe recommend that Forum members join the mailing lists dedicated to FTS and Spat users (fts@ircam.fr and spat@ircam.fr) in order to exchange infos and ideas with other FTS or Spat users, and obtain complements to the on-line documentation.Some general and technical information on the Spatialisateur project can befound at http://www.ircam.fr/equipes/salles/spat/index-e.html.Comments, questions and suggestions are welcome by e-mail at spat@ircam.fr, jmjot@ircam.fr, or nouno@ircam.fr
