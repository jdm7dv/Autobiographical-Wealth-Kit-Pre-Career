Getting Started===============1. Contents-----------On a Unix system (SGI or NeXT), the Spat-1.1 folder should contain:doc		      Documentation.examples	  Ready-to-use example patches.lib		      Library of Spat~ objects.lib-0.26	  Additional library for compatibility with Max-0.26.tools		    Scripts for launching FTS (and quitting),            and 2-D graphic interface.b32_		     Databases of binaural and transaural b44_		      filter coefficients for sample ratesb48_		      32 kHz, 44.1 kHz, 48 kHz, respectively.On a Mac, the folders lib-0.26, b32_, and b48_ are not necessary, and the help-patches are in a separate 'help' folder.2. Paper documentation and on-line help---------------------------------------Introduction Manual (Spat-0.1, October 1994): introduces the user to the general principles and conventions adopted in the design of Spat~.Reference Manual (Spat-0.1, March 1995): detailed operational description of the Max objects in the Spat~ library. Most of this information is also accessible through the standard on-line help mechanism provided in Max (the help patch pops up whenever the user alt-clicks on the corresponding box in a patch).For a new user, we recommended reading the introduction manual first, as well as the 'release_notes' document in the 'doc' folder (which contains updates to the introduction and reference manuals). We then suggest trying the example patches (found in the `examples' folder). It may also be useful to flip through the reference manual or open some of the main help-patches.3. Default search path----------------------To be able to use Spat~ modules with FTS in your own patches, you simply need to add the path to the 'lib' folder in the Max Default Search Path. If you are using binaural or transaural processing, you must also specify the path for the binaural filter coefficient database, i.e. one of the folders 'b32_', 'b44_', 'b48_' depending on the sample rate you are running at.If you are using Max-0.26 (or 0.25) on a NeXT/ISPW workstation, the simplest method is to copy the contents of the 'lib-0.26' folder into the 'lib' folder. Aternatively, you must can add the path to the 'lib-0.26' folder (prior to that of the 'lib' folder) in the Max default search path, although in this case the help patches will not work properly (because they contain a "declare" object which supersedes the Max default search path).On a Mac, you can put an alias of the Spat-1.1 folder in the Max folder, and an alias of the 'help' folder in the 'max-help' folder (and configure the 'file preferences' in Max accordingly).
