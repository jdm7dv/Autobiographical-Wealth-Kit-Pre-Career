This is the README file for version 1.2 of Spat for MSP.New features:-> in binaural mode:    ----------------- objects related to the data base of binaural filters (or HRTF) are all stored in the libhrtf directory. The user must now load the patch load_hrtf.pat in order to load the filters, and then set the variable Spat@2b-Head to the name of the data base, which is BinauralHead. This database retrieves information about the source position thanks to variable Spat@2b-Az, and sends in turn the coefficients of the corresponding filter in variable Spat@2b-Filter.Spat@2b-Az is sent by panb2~, which receives in turn the filters coefficients from Spat@2b-Filter.IACC filters (used by various diff~ objects: 2b-diff~ and 2d-diff~) are also store inside this load_hrtf.pat patch, as well as the conversion filters transaural mode <-> binaural mode. For these last ones, the receive message arrives into variable Spat@2b-corners and Spat@2t-corners sent by shuff_trans, and the filter coefficients are sent to variable Spat@2bt-Filter to the same shuff_trans.Note that the same HRTF database can manage the spatialization of several sources at the same time.See also: shuff_iacc, shuff_iacc_4_4, fltbank, transbank, hrtf_panb2, hrtf_panb2_bank,hrtf_outb2, hrtf_outb2_bank, hrtf_outt2, hrtf_outt2_bank.- objects related to the tracking of the listener's head. Messages from a LOGITECH headtracker can be sent through a serial port of your Macintosh; they are captured in MSP by object HTlogitech. The (yaw,pitch,roll) rotation angles of the head are then compensated for in headtrack. This object has been included into traditionnal Spat object Pan+, which receives the headtracker messages from an extra variable Spat@2b-HT.See also: Pan_HT, YAWconvert, PITCHconvert, ROLLconvert, xy2deg, cart2sph.- objects related to the conversion of traditionnal Max-0.26 2p2z~ object into FTS biquad~.See: iir12~ and iir4~.You can mail support requests (bug reports, requests for features or explanations, etc.) to jmjot@ircam.fr., larcher@ircam.fr, warusfel@ircam.fr       ---------- COPYRIGHT/PATENT NOTICE AND DISCLAIMER ---------- This software is intended for use with Max and MSP on Macintosh computers.The use of this software and its documentation is restricted to members of the Ircam software user group.
