This is the README file for version 2.0 of Spat for MSP.New features:The main features of version 2.0 are :	- rewriting of main Spat~ DSP objects as external objects,	- 3D objects for vbap and ambisonics encoding/decoding technics1) External objects  The main DSP objects of Spat~ library have been written as external objects (C version). The envisionned improvement is of course the optimization of computer cost and hence an increasing number of simultaneous spatialized sources. The main objects which have been ported in C are :Reverberation family :		8c-reverb~ and 8b-reverb~, reverb8~		8c-cluster~, cluster8~		8c-early~		which means that any Spat~ application using 8c, 8b (and also 8a) room modules should run faster. (On the contrary, 4c and 6c versions will show very little difference).Panning family :	panr[4,5,6,7,8]~	panv8~, panv10~ and panv16~Filter family :	iir6~, iir12~, iir12v~ and iir20~(used mainly for binaural rendering)Gain family:	pw~ and amp~ and their multichannel derivatives (pw_[4,8]~ and amp_[2,3,4,8]~)Mixing matrix family:	hada4~, hada8~, shuffle4~ and shuffle8~The average gain in computer cost, compared with the patch version, is about 40%. Further optimizations are envisionned for G4 stations, using Altivec compilation options (expected for next release in April 2001).2) 3D encoding and decoding objectsVBAP : The VBAP technic is a 3D extension of the classical pairwise panning technic. It allows to pan pot a source on a 3D setup of loudspeakers surrounding the audience. A given image source is rendered by weigthing the 3 loudspeakers that define a triangle which intercepts the direction of the image source. This vbap object has been implemented using V.Pulki's method. The user has to define the Cartesian coordinates of the loudspeakers, and (in this first version) the  different triangles of the surface enveloppe that surrounds the audience : each triangle beeing defined by a triplet of loudspeaker index.  Ambisonics: Decoding modules of B format have been added for a 3D loudspeaker setup composed with 8 HP in a cubic frame. Rotation and focusing (4a_focus) effects of a B_format Sound scene have been added.3) InstallationNota Bene 1: external objects have been stored in a subdirectory of "lib", named "lib-externs". Classical patches and abstractions (including old versions of these external objects) are stored in the "lib_patches" subdirectory. In order that Max loads external version of these Spat~ objects, it is important to keep these names unchanged. Nota Bene 2: the "lib_externs" subdirectory comprises a subdirectory "extern_compatibility" which contains patches that insure a full compatibility with version 1.2.2. Hence, your "old" Max applications using Spat modules should load without requiring any modifications, and should sound and behave as before.Nota Bene 3 :If you would prefer to go back to patches versions of Spat modules (for example to compare the computer cost), the easiest way is to rename the subdirectories "lib_externs" and "lib_patches" so that the patches subdirectory is now first in alphabetic order (for example "lib_externs" --> "lib_b" and "lib_patches" --> "lib_a"). In that case Max will load in priority the patches versions.Nota Bene 4: The development of 3D patches required some modifications in several panning objects. For the same reasons as above, the subdirectory "3D_lib", which contains some compatibility objects should not be renamed, unless verifying that it preserves the alphabetic order.You can mail support requests (bug reports, requests for features or explanations, etc.)  warusfel@ircam.fr, larcher@ircam.fr       ---------- COPYRIGHT/PATENT NOTICE AND DISCLAIMER ---------- This software is intended for use with Max and MSP on Macintosh computers.The use of this software and its documentation is restricted to members of the Ircam software user group.
