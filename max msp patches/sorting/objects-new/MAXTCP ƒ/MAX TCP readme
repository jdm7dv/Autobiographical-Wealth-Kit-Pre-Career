THIS IS THE LATEST UPDATE (12/5/96)MORE RELEASED ON OUR WWW PAGESincluded a "info" message. Information about the connection is sent to the MAX page.The help file is updated as well.About a unkown bug:It seems that when one connection end crashes, the other end also crashes. That sounds strange. It is possible however that the other end tries to close the connection, and waits for the crashed end (which is not there anymore) to close its connection. And waits forever and ever.....However this should never happen, because there is always a timeout value which takes over and cancels the waiting process.Please send us more detailed information about bugs. Try to discribe what went wrong.On the Server side first, or not ...While sending data, or not....Etc.*************************************update 20/2/96About TCP objects for the MAXfor objects:client and server object for MAX our now the same. Just send the message to the object.for compiling :copy the TCP includes folder to your Think C folder.It is the general header for access to TCP functions develloped by Apple.((c) Copyright 1988-1992 by Apple Computer.  All rights reserved)It is also possible to keep these files local to your project, but then you have more things to do when updatting these headers and sources.Anyway  I put it in the Think C folder, and that seems to work fine.Other headers and sources are local to the project.Included are the project files for Think C, but all obj files are removed to keep it small. You have to compile & link the project yourself.Any Resource files are included, if needed.for source:At first reading there seems to be be a overhead in source code. This is because all programs were develloped on trial and error base. Some changes are copied to other programs, and some are not. Finally all programs works the way we want, and that was our only concern. We didn't have time to clean it up. (update 16/2/96)There is a major difference between the server and the client. For now we don't have time to fix it. Just use what you need. Later on we will clean up the mess and the MAX object is simular to client or server. Its your choice what you want !Although there are some diffs in the source code it will work.Trying to get simular interface to MAX for both client and server will take us some time.
