r3Dview LiteWhat is r3Dview? r3Dview is an external for Max, which allows to read 3DMF files, and navigatein them. It allows to set up lights, and a lot of 3D rendering options. It usesthe QuickDraw3D (TM) and Quicktime (TM) libraries.So why a lite version?As Apple licensed OPenGL recently, and there is no real indication on the futureof QD3D (although it will be supported under 8.X) it would be not very honest to sell a complete version of a product which might be obsolete in a few months.So give the complete version !r3Dview was designed for 3D audio simulation based on geometrical model.  Sosome things are very 3D audio oriented (just like the second inlet and outlet). It needs a little bit of work, to be more general, and be used in other situations.And work is time, and time is.... All that depends on the feedback of the users,and it might be licensed for a modic fee.What is not in the Lite version?Creation of "sources" objects, light operation, full screen, and some camera options.Will it be improved and how?Probably, with more rendering options, and creation of standalone 3D objects.Will it be open sourced?See above. It will depend (once again) on the feedback of the users, and the evolution of QD3D.Will there be an OpenGL based version?Probably, but not in a very near future.Enjoy Laurent Cerveau, MMyneta 1999.http://www.mmyneta.comdevfeedback@mmyneta.com
