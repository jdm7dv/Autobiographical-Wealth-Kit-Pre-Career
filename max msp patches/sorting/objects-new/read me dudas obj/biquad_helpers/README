This folder contains a set of Max/MSP patchersyou can use when you want to set filter cutoff andQ values to feed the MSP biquad~ object but don'tneed the display capabilities of the filtergraph~object. To use them, just put the "biquad_coef" folderin the "patches" folder in the folder where yourMax/MSP application lives, and put the "biquad_coef help"folder into the max-help folder.To use the objects, simply supply cutoff frequencyvalues and Q values to the patcher, and connect theoutput of the patcher to the second inlet of theMSP biquad~ object.The biquad_coef contains the following patchers:coef_hpf outputs coefficients for a highpass filtercoef_ghpf outputs coefficients for a highpass filter with gaincoef_lpf outputs coefficients for a lowpass filtercoef_glpf outputs coefficients for a lowpass filter with gaincoef_bpf outputs coefficients for a bandpass filtercoef_gbpf outputs coefficients for a bandpass filter with gaincoef_notch outputs coefficients for a notch filtercoef_gnotch outputs coefficients for a notch filter with gaincoef_peaknotch outputs coefficients for a peaknotch filtercoef_hish outputs coefficients for a highshelf parametric filtercoef_losh outputs coefficients for a highshelf parametric filter
