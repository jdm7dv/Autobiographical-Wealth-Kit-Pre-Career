This means that all of the light rays are parallel \, which reduces the computation somewhat.;#P comment 46 292 300 9 The R G B is the color of the light.;#P comment 45 314 300 9 Keep in mind that the attributes have to be set before rendering the vertices \, so if you are trying for frame accurate rendering \, you will want to set the gemhead order to a low nuber so that all of the values of the light get set first.;#P connect 6 0 3 0;#P connect 4 0 3 1;#P pop;
