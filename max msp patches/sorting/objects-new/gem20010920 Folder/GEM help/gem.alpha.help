If you want a different blending technique \, you will need to make your own external. The blending that alpha does is the "stereotypical" blending which you will usually want. In a nutshell \, any pixel which has an alpha component will be blended with the pixel that is in the frame buffer \, producing the usual "colored glass" effect. Beaware that the rendering order matters \, so you probably want to set the gemhead order number high so that the newexect is rendered after all of the non-alpha blended ones.;#P comment 26 35 115 1310744 gem.alpha;#P message 30 89 42 9 gemList;#P comment 158 44 100 9 GEM object;#P connect 6 0 4 0;#P connect 1 0 4 0;#P connect 4 0 5 0;#P pop;
