GEM provides two types of lights, a local light and worldlight.<p>OpenGL uses a vertex lighting model.&nbsp; This means that for everyvertex in the scene, the influence of the light is calculated.&nbsp; Thecolor for the polygon is then modified by the light value of all of thevertices.&nbsp; This generally produces a very smooth effect, but you willoccasionally run into rendering artifacts, especially if you use locallights.&nbsp; For example, imagine you have a local light close a largesquare.&nbsp; The corners of the square are far away from the light, sonone of them will be lit very brightly, even though the light itself isvery close to the surface of the square.<p>It is important to realize that lighting is an expensive operation touse.&nbsp; The number of polygons that you will be able to render willbe much lower if lighting is turned on.&nbsp; As usual, the complexityof the scene and the speed of your computer and graphics card will greatlyaffect your frame rate.<p>GEM has only a maximum of 8 lights at one time.&nbsp; If you try tocreate more lights than that, you will get an error message.<p><a href="#Activate">Activate lighting</a><br><a href="#world_light">world_light</a> - A directional light<br><a href="#light">light</a> - A point light in the world<br><a href="#Moving">Moving lights</a><p><img SRC="tribar.gif" height=13 width=561><h3><a NAME="Activate"></a>Activate lighting</h3>Lighting is activated by sending a message to <i>gemwin</i>.&nbsp; If yousend "lighting 1", then lighting will be turned on.&nbsp; If you send "lighting0", then lighting will be turned off.&nbsp; The lighting state is kepteven if you destroy the gemwin.&nbsp; This means that if you close a patchand open another one, the lighting will still be the same.<p>Individual lights can be turned on and off by sending a 1 or 0 to theleft inlet of the light object itself.<p><img SRC="tribar.gif" height=13 width=561><h3><a NAME="world_light"></a>world_light</h3>A <i>world_light</i> is a light which exists infintely far away.&nbsp;This reduces the computation needed, so your patch can run faster, butit means that all of the light rays are parallel.&nbsp; The <i>world_light</i>is good for objects like the sun and other lighting affects.&nbsp; Thismeans that translating a <i>world_light</i> has no effect, although rotationdoes.<p>The following patch is gem_lighting/gem1.world_light.pd.<center><p><img SRC="world_light.jpg" BORDER=1 height=152 width=370></center><p>The <i>world_light</i> has one extra inlet.&nbsp; The right inlet acceptsthree floats to set the color of the light.&nbsp; A <i>color</i> objectwould do nothing.&nbsp; In this case, the light is being set to purple.&nbsp;The <i>world_light</i> also accepts a debug message.&nbsp; The debug messageturns on and off a graphical representation of the light in the scene.&nbsp;The <i>world_light</i> looks like a cone.&nbsp; The cone shows the directionthat the light is coming from.&nbsp; Remember that the actual positionof the light does not matter, so geos behind the cone will still be lit.&nbsp;It is the direction of the light that matters.&nbsp; This is why you canrotate the light.<p><img SRC="tribar.gif" height=13 width=561><h3><a NAME="light"></a>light</h3>A <i>light</i> object generates a point light in the world.&nbsp; Becausethe light is local to the scene, there is more math to generate the effectof the light on the vertices.&nbsp; However, unlike a <i>world_light</i>,you can translate the <i>light</i> object.<p>Below is the patch gem_lighting/gem2.light.pd.<center><p><img SRC="light.jpg" BORDER=1 height=215 width=212></center><p>The <i>light</i> object has a right inlet for the color, just lightthe <i>world_light</i> object.&nbsp; As this patch shows, the light canbe moved around the scene with both <i>rotate</i> and <i>translate</i>objects.&nbsp; If you were to set the translate X value equal to 1.0, thenthe sphere would not be lit at all.&nbsp; This is because the light wouldbe inside of the sphere.&nbsp; When you turn on the debug representation,it is a sphere with its origin where the light it.&nbsp; The <i>light</i>object does not have any size.&nbsp; It exists as a point source.<p><img SRC="tribar.gif" height=13 width=561><h3><a NAME="Moving"></a>Moving lights</h3>The patch gem_lighting/gem3.controlLights.pd allows you to move a <i>light</i>and <i>world_light</i> object in the same scene to see the difference betweenthe two objects.<p>The patch gem_lighting/gem4.moveSpheres.pd is an example which movestwo spheres around the world.&nbsp; Turn on and off the individual lightsfor a demonstration of a local versus infinite light.<p>The patch gem_lighting/gem5.materials.pd uses the material objects toselectively control the color of the object. Notice that the diffuse objectsets the "overall" color, while the specular objects sets the bright reflectivearea where the light directly shines.<p><img SRC="tribar.gif" height=13 width=561><p><a href="index.html">[return]</a><br>&nbsp;</body></html>
