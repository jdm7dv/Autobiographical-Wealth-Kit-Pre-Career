scope                                      9/12/99is a utillity patcher using msp`s scope~ object and joshua kit claytons peak~ object.it has an auto-range feature which automatically adjusts Input Gain, Offset, and Trigger Level. This feature can  also be triggerd manually by pressing the bang buttom while the auto mode is set to AutoOFF.scope ( and scope~ ...)  works well with frequencies between 1 hz and ~ 500 Hz. Lower Frequencies take too long to update, while higher frequencies do not look like you`d expect...scope`s audio input can be accessed by using "send~ scope"  from any patcher.comments welcome.robert henke / monolakewww.monolake.derob@monolake.de
