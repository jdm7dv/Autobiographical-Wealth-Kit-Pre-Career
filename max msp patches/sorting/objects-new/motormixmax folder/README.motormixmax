motormixmaxmax/msp support for the motormixthe motormix is an automated control surface made by cm labs. it has 8 motorized faders, 9 continuous rotary knobs, 67 switches with individual LED's, an 80-character lcd screen, and a 2-digit segmented numerical display - all in a compact and well-designed enclosure.the automation and flexibility make it an ideal controller for max/msp. i have been using it for over two years. my once-sprawling live performance setup has been reduced to the motormix and a powerbook running max/msp (radiaL). motormixmax consists of four externals, and a few example files. they should provide everything you need to design motormix interfaces in max. if you have any ideas about ways the objects could be enhanced, please let me know. the main goal here was to save others from the tedium of implementing a pile of sysex and hex codes. the mmparse and mmformat objects provide no-frills translation of motormix MIDI to and from readable max messages. although this is enough to work with, the more elaborate mmhub/mmpm system lets you organize parameters into pages, which maintain their state as you navigate through them with the automated surface. also, they handle common tasks, like responding to button presses. for most situations, mmhub/mmpm are recommended. IMPORTANT: to use a motormix with max, make sure it is *not* in protools mode. to toggle between normal and protools mode, hold down "play" and "escape" during power up. a good place to start is the "vmix" example patch. it gives you a "virtual motormix" in max, so you can verify that MIDI communication is working and see how the max objects operate at the simplest level. the motormix display in mmhub.help is a bit nicer (and smaller!). it implements the same thing, using mmhub/mmpm.the mmfm example uses mmhub/mmpm to create a step-sequencer-driven fm synthesizer. i wrote this in about a day, so it is not laid out very clearly. the important thing, in my opinion, is to see the motormix as a blank slate, and to explore what can be done with its bi-directional interface. the mmhub/mmpm objects are documented in one big patcher, mmhub.help. if you have problems or suggestions, regarding the objects, feel free to send me email. please keep in mind that this is my own personal project, and not supported by cycling '74. motormixmax is free but carries no warranties whatsoever. i use the motormix all the time, so i intend to keep the system up-to-date. so far, they have been stable and reliable for myself and others. special thanks to carl malone/c.m. labs, and david zicarelli/cycling74. enjoy, jhnoear@subminimal.commore info on:c.m. labs, the motormix, and a nice companion suface called the "dashboard":   http://www.cmlabs.net cycling 74, makers of max/msp, pluggo, upcoming radiaL:    http://www.cycling74.comjhno/spool/delicate ear/subminimal   http://subminimal.com/ear---++tech tipsthis information is handy to have around, just in case: TroubleshootingIf Motor Mix does not respond properly, you can run the built in self-test in Motor Mix. Simply connect the MIDI output directly into the MIDI input on Motor Mix and apply power. The LCD should show ”Performing Customer self test”. Then it will perform:1.) Memory (SRAM) test. Motor Mix should report “SRAM IS O.K”. Press the “SHIFT” and “UNDO” switches to end the test.2.) MIDI ports test. Motor Mix should report “MIDI IS O.K. Press the “SHIFT” and “UNDO” switches to end the test.3.) Pots and Encoder test. Rotate the pots slowly, and the faders should move up and down. Rotate the encoder, and all the faders should move up and down. Push all the switches, and all the LED’s should light. Push the encoder, and all the faders should move repeatedly from bottom to top. Press the “SHIFT” and “UNDO” switches to end the test.4.) Fader test. Move the faders, and you should see their position reading on the LCD go from 000 to 255. Press the “SHIFT” and “UNDO” switches to end the test. Remove the MIDI “jumper” cable and re-patch the MIDI cables. Connect the Motor Mix MIDI out jack to the MIDI input on your computer MIDI interface. Connect your computer MIDI out jack to the MIDI input jack on Motor Mix.If Motor Mix passes these tests then you can look for problems elsewhere.Motor Mix Hidden Switch FunctionsDuring Power Up:SHIFT performs self-demo.PLAY * ESCAPE toggles Pro Tools mode on and off. During Normal Operations.1.) Hold down SHIFT to delay touch release until SHIFT is released.[note: the max objects ignore touch release data]
