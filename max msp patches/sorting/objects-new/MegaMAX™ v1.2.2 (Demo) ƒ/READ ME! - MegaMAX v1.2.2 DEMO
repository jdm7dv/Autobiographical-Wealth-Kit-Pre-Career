There is an application included named "MegaMAXª 1.2.2 Addendum", which is a self-opening document. Please consult it for all relevant information, includingINSTALLATIONThis demo version is fully-functional, in that you can launch Max with the objects in the startup folder, and create and experiment with User Interfaces and all the other non-UI objects, and open all of the .help files.  You simply cannot save any patchers containing the objects.  They will either disappear or become corrupt next time you open the patcher.If you like this demo, please buy the collection.  It's not very expensive (in the grand scheme of things) and it allows me to continue making cool MAX objects for little or no profit.TO ORDERPlease go to www.musikinetix.com, click on "Order", download the Order Forms application, and follow the instructions there.Thanks,Stephen Kay
