modular.refcourtesy of Jeremy Bernstein and Johnny DeKam11.06.00general notes+ place the "texter" patch into max's search path. "modular.ref" is the only patch you need to open, but it won't work unless it can find "texter". i generally place "modular.ref" into my max-startup folder, and "texter" into my patches folder. this works nicely.+ ensure that NATO modular r3f documents are in max search path.-changes to 11.06.00+ added "242.kodek" to the list-changes to 07.06.00+ rewrite to improve reliability, in response to the clever naming convention adopted by Netochka Nezvanova. the item list is now stored outside of the menu, and is reloaded each time modular.ref is opened. + added "242.desat" to the list.-changes to 06.06.00+ the collective version of modular.ref has been discontinued, for no good reason. but since it was made for no good reason, i think this is ok. if there are any die-hard collective users, email me at jeremy@bootsquad.com and complain.+ this version incorporates updates to NATO modular since the most recent full release, dated 28.05.00. specifically, it removes reference to the "242.film track.edit" document, which was replaced by "242.film \ edit" and "242.film \ edit 2". due to problems encountered (as a result of the naming convention -- \ means something to max), these two document names appear slightly differently in the menu. i might caution against getting info on the menu object, which will cause the \ characters to condense (to nothing), and break modular.ref. "this sentence is false."please distribute modular.ref freely, as long as it is accompanied by this document. modular.ref should not be distributed as part of any for-profit package.the most recent version of this distribution can generally be found at:http://www.bootsquad.com/maxlet/modular.ref.sit.bin
