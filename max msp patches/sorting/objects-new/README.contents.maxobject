It is centered around a (partial) port of the Synthesis Toolkit(STK) by Perry Cook (Princeton) and Gary Scavone (Stanford CCRMA). Like the STK,it provides a fairly easy to use library of synthesis and signal processing functions (in C)that can be wired together to create conventional and unusual instruments. Also like theSTK, it includes a variety of precompiled synthesis objects, including physical modeling,modal, and PhISM class instruments; the code for these instruments can serve asfoundations for creating new instruments (one example, the blotar, is included) and canbe used to teach elementary and advanced synthesis techniques. Given itÕs STK heritageand educational function, PeRColate is largely un-optimized, though all the objects runon a 80MHz 7100, which is pretty good. PeRColate also includes a number of objects notfrom the STK; some are from RTcmix and others are our own evil creations, designed tocrash your computer, but only after making some kind of interesting sound.***MSP Spat 2.0.sitSpat is a 3-D audio rendering and artificial reverberation software allowing reconstruction of three-dimensional virtual sound scenes by processing and mixing mono or stereo source signals. The modularity and configurability make the software adaptable to a variety of application contexts, including musical composition in the studio, concert performance, sound reinforcement, post-production of recordings and soundtracks, multimedia or virtual reality systems.***MSP jimmies 1.1.sitThe Jimmies is an historical collection of patches, abstractions and external objects devel-opedfor the MAX/FTS environment on the ISPW at the beginning of the 1990s, andassembled into a formal collection of tools by Zack Settel in 1993. Lots of useful effects and utilities.***meter.seaA much better level meter than the default.***max_storage.sitAn example of how to use coll lists to store/recall presets.by marcel.wierckx@www2.hku.nl***SingerLibrary 1.sitFun graphing looping and plotting objects from Eric Singer.***Lobjects.sitThe famous Lobjects, for all your list processing needs.Peter Elsea 1997***Allusions Ä.sitNeat FFT effects.***kastro~ object v1.0  ©1999 Stefania SerafinExtended Karplus-Strong algorithm as proposed by D.
