changes 30/09/00a midi input module has been added, which can be opened by clicking on the [midi] checkbox.this is designed to be used with a fader box, specifically the Peavey 1600x. all 16 faders are used, and the first 4 buttons. if you use another fader box that doesn't have switches, you can use a midi keyboard to control the 4 buttons.(C3 to E3)faders: 1-4 are permanently assigned.5-12 can be assigned to control either  the level faders or the pans.13-15 control various parameters in either the [grain] or the [ringmod] modules.the button controls can be either latching (press on/press off - default) or momentary (press on/release off); this is set by the 4 larger check boxes.a few problems with the default settings were also fixed.
