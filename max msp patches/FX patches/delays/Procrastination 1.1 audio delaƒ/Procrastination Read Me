ProcrastinationProcrastination is a delay/looping system for audio. It is inspired by the music of Robert Fripp, Brian Eno, Paul Dresher and David Torn. The only requirement is that you allocate at least 48 MB of RAM to Max  or MaxPlay (see 10/22 update below for "lite" version). Any less will cause the patcher to not function correctly. Some or all of the delay lines will fail to produce sound.  If your system does not have the required RAM, you could edit the patcher to use lower delay times or reduce the total number of delay lines.If you need the free runtime version of MSP (MaxPlay), see http://www.cycling74.com/.Here is a brief explanation of the controls and how this patcher operates. This explanation follows the signal path of the audio.1.) First, there is the start/stop audio button located at the lower right of the window.  This simply toggles Procrastinator's audio processing on and off.2.) Procrastination takes a stereo audio signal and then routes it to 4 separate delay lines. Audio is routed as follows: The left input goes to delay lines #1 and #3. The right input goes to delay lines #2 and #4. The original audio signal is sent directly to the outputs before being sent to the delay lines. You can set the balance between the original audio (Dry) and the delayed audio (Wet) by using the EFX mix slider (located near the bottom right of the patcher's window).  By default the slider is set to 50% Dry and 50% Wet.3.) Each delay line can be set to a maximum of 60 seconds (60000 milliseconds). Delay times for each delay line can be set by turning the appropriate dial or by directly entering the delay time (in milliseconds) into the appropriate box. Note: any numbers entered directly into the number box will not move the dial to reflect the new number.4.) The audio can then be panned as follows: Off (mutes the delay line - audio continues to be processed), Left, Center, Right.  Use the popup menu to make your choice.5.) Each delay line can be set to feedback as low as 1 repeat and as high as infinite.  O% feedback results in 1 repeat. 100% feedback results in infinite repeats. With infinite repeats, very complex loops can be created.  Procrastination will keep layering any new audio it receives into the infinite loop.The delay feedback is set exactly how the delay time is set. Feedback percentage for each delay line can be set by turning the appropriate dial or by directly entering the percentage (0 to 100) into the appropriate box. Note: any numbers entered directly into the number box will not move the dial to reflect the new number.6.) You can erase all the audio from an individual delay line by pressing the appropriate clear button. This allows you to delete a loop and then re-use it's delay line to create a new one.7.) The total audio level of all delay lines and original signal can be read using the peak output meters. A reading of 1 is optimal. Anything above 1 indicates distortion of the signal.  The meters are not calibrated to any reference. Use your ears as a guide to what sounds best.8.) You can record audio to a stereo file at any time.  The supported formats are Sound Designer II and AIFF. You can only record one format at a time.  Clicking the appropriate box will open a dialog box asking for the name of the file. Once a file is chosen, recording can be turned on with the Recording On/Off button.  Once recording is turned off, turning record back on will not add to the just recorded file. It does not function like a punch in/out button. However, you could start a new record file because Procrastinator continues to process audio whether it is recording or not. This can be done any number of times. Future Plans:Procrastination is a work in progress.  I have many additions and improvements planned. The first major change will add better routing of the incoming audio. Some type of on screen mixer will be implemented. I also plan on adding MIDI control of delay and audio parameters. There is no timeline for these changes.  You may visit my website to find out about Procrastination news and updates. There are examples of music I created with Procrastinator available in Real Audio format. The site's address is http://www.eclipse.net/~kmistove/. I also maintain a small mailing list that I send out periodically with any Procrastination news. You may sign up for that by sending me a message at kmistove@eclipse.net. Your e-mail address is kept confidential and will never be given to anybody.****************Update 9/30/98: After many months away from this patcher it's time to get back into it.  The updated tapin~ object is now officially part of MSP release 5 and has been removed from the archive.VST plug-ins are now officially supported in MSP.  I plan on adding support inm the audio chain of Procrastination.Update 10/22/98:Added "lite" version to the archive. Allocate a minumum of 24 MB of RAM to Max or MaxPlay for best results. I'll send update announcements to the Looper's digest in the future.Update 10/25/98:Version 1.1 - Archive now contains Procrastination (48MB), Procrastination lite (24MB), and Procrastination long (48MB). The new long version has one delay line of 4 minutes long. I kept the old versions (1.0) in the archive for the time being.New features: added delay line input  on/off switches. This is a start toward more flexible input routing.Removals: I took out the delay time and feedback dials. This allows for more precise input of times and percentages. I may add them back in at a later time. As more features are addded, I run out of screen space. For now I'm trying to accomodate those with 640 x 480 displays to use the program. 800 x 600 may be required as the program grows.***************Some final notes:Procrastination is freeware. I will never charge for it. You have my permission to modify the patcher in anyway you want.  Please send any bugs, suggestions, etc. to me at kmistove@eclipse.net.Thanks to David Zicarelli for MSP. Have fun!Ken Mistove kmistove@eclipse.nethttp://www.eclipse.net/~kmistove/10/25/98
