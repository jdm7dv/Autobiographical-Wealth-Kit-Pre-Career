*** qtlivedounloadDownloads quicktime streams from the internet and plays the movie in the max patcher.*** nato-3d coll patchNot quite sure what this does. Looks like it defines some points on a line to be passed as camera position values to 242.3d. Requires the 'show' and 'insert' objects, which I don't have and i believe are non-standard.*** 0t0001d.seaA very strange abstraction that doesn't seem to do anything on my computer besides display a lot of windows.*** choi.nato.tut01.sitSome decent nato tutorials.Young ChoiBrown Universitychoi@csounds.comhttp://radiobaton.com*** nato tutorial .sitAn unusable (as far as I know) tutorial written by J. Berstein and J. DeKamm.*** natomodules.sitA very good set of help files and patchers for the current version of nato.*** patch-taphelp.seaPerhaps the best set of help files for many nato objects.
