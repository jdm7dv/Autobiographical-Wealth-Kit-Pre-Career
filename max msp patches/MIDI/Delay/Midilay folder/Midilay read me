    Midilay is a midi delay line with a difference; it's not a million miles from the 'midi echo' module found in Cubase, but different enough to be interesting - and it's free, of course ; )  To run midilay, open Max or Maxplay and configure your OMS inputs & outputs - midilay defaults to port 'A' for both but you can change that from within Midilay, so you could use it as an accesory to Cubase/Vision/Pro-Tools etc. via the IAC bus. Then open Midilay etc. etc.    Each tap is a single delay line with feedback; 'time' sets the delay time in msec., decay sets the amount the velocity value is reduced each delay (ie. feedback) and transpose allows each delay to be transposed up or down to create bizarre arpeggio effects. The delay and decay settings can be set seperately or you can link them to the next tap in either linear or exponential relationship with the menus between each tap. At the top is a 'global' row which links the whole lot. Clicking on the '0' in the transpose column, zeros the lot ie. sets them to unison.At the end of each row is a 'n>m' button, which causes the output of that tap to be fed into the input of the following one, to create richer delays often with more interesting rhythms.At the bottom is an autopan feature that allows you to set the pan values of consecutive delays; 'frequency' refers to how often the taps are panned to the left & right values, ie. 1 will pan each tap to alternative R & L pan values. Presets are stored/recalled in the usual Max fashion, ie. shift-click to store, click to recall.  Sorry about the sparse 'manual' and user interface - I'm still working on this one : )
