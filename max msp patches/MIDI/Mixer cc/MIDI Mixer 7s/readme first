MOTU Midi Mixer 7s - 1997 - Johnny DeKamHere is collection of interfaces that control the Mark of the UnicornMIDI Mixer 7s - a single space rackmount, MIDI controlled Midi mixer.  These units were fairly abundant, though, not currently manufactured anymore.  You may still be able to obtain one from http://www.sweetwater.com/  - I picked mine up at a local music store for less than $150.  Its great for automating audio mixes in installation or performance work, or as a general line mixer in a project studio.  The folder includes two collectives and a modifiable patch.  All programming uses a standard syntax for send and receive objects, so that one can easily send values from anywhere with a system of MAX patches (without having to hardwire)  You could also elect to use a preset object w/receive, to store snapshots of the mixer settings.  the patch also uses omsinfo to automatically determine your MIDI setup, and define what port to send values on.  The main thing is that all the work of programming the controller values to access the MIDI Mixer’s hardware has been done for you.Sorry, I have not documented the labels for the send/receives, but they are easily identifiable in one location.  I have easily interfaced a Peavy 1600x fader box with the 7s to give ‘hard control’ of the unit.Questions/comments further info:  http://node.net/MAX/-- Johnny DeKam
